## What Pathmind Is

Pathmind lets you build automation with a visual graph instead of writing commands or scripts. You place nodes, connect them, configure parameters, then run the graph in-game.

The current mod includes:

- A visual editor for building automation graphs in-game.
- Workspace and preset management for saving and organizing your graphs.
- Runtime automation features for executing workflows and reacting to game state.
- Pathfinding and movement automation, with optional integrations for expanded behavior.
- An in-game marketplace for sharing and discovering community presets.
- HUD and editor feedback to help monitor execution and troubleshoot graphs.

## Feature Overview

### Visual Editor

- Full-screen graph editing built around nodes and connections.
- Tools for organizing, editing, and validating workflows.
- Customizable editor presentation and general usability settings.

### Nodes And Logic

- Node categories for flow control, world interaction, player actions, data handling, sensing, parameters, and reusable logic.
- Support for combining simple actions into larger automation workflows.
- Reusable graph structures for building modular systems.

### Execution And Runtime

- Run graphs directly in-game and monitor what they are doing.
- Build workflows that respond to events, conditions, and changing state.
- Use runtime state and feedback overlays while automation is active.

### Navigation And Pathfinding

Pathmind ships with its own local movement backend and also supports Baritone-aware nodes.

- Built-in movement and pathfinding support for navigation-focused automation.
- Optional Baritone integration for players who want expanded navigation behavior.
- Visual feedback for navigation state while workflows are running.

### Marketplace

The in-game marketplace is more than a static browser:

- Browse shared presets from inside the mod.
- Import community presets into your own workspace.
- Publish and manage your own presets through the in-game UI.

## Controls

Default keybinds:

- Open editor: `Right Alt`
- Play graphs: `K`
- Stop graphs: `J`

Pathmind also adds main-menu integration so the editor is reachable before joining a world.

## Installation

### Required

- Minecraft `1.21.1`
- NeoForge `21.1` or newer
- Java `21+`

### Optional

- Baritone API mod for Baritone-backed nodes and extended navigation/building integration

### Steps

1. Install NeoForge for Minecraft `1.21.1`.
2. Download the Pathmind NeoForge jar from Modrinth.
3. Place the jar in your `mods` folder.
4. Launch the game and open Pathmind with the configured keybind.

## Workspace Files

Pathmind stores data inside your Minecraft directory under `pathmind/`.

- `pathmind/presets/`: saved workspace graphs
- `pathmind/active_preset.txt`: current preset selection

Imported marketplace presets and exported graphs also flow through this preset system.
